**Voting**

A smart contract which proposes a referendum voting system.

Members need to register first with 0.1 ether for 4 weeks and buy extra time afterwards.
They can be promoted to admin status by another admin. Admins can be denoted by an admin. Admins can submit proposals and warn members in case malicious acts (if there are more than 2 warnings, a member is blacklisted). All members can vote for proposals (0 -> Blank, 1 -> Yes, 2 -> No)

All function calls are currently implemented without side effects.
